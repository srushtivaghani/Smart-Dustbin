# Smart-Dustbin
Smart Dustbin using Arduino with Ultrasonic Sensor, servo motor and LED Alert
Problems:
Over flowing of dustbin.
Inappropriate Waste Management.
People not concerned with their duties.
Lack of dustbins at a particular place.

#Objectives

Develop a smart dustbin using ultrasonic sensor and Servo motor.
Develop an automated system decreases the work load of human regarding the cleanliness of the environment.

#Methodology

The methodology are as follow:

To throw the trash into dustbin without an efforts we can use ultrasonic sensor to sense the object which will open the lid automatically using Servo motor.

In order to find out if the dustin is filled or not, we can use various sort of sensors such as IR sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor and Weight sensors. For this project, the Ultrasonic sensor has been used.

Some of the other instrumentation utilized in the project is Arduino, Jumper wires(male and female), Battery*, Dust Bin, Arduino holder, Breadboard, Servo motor, LED light, etc.

We have placed the ultrasonic sensor on the front of dustbin where the ultrasonic waves can interact to the object and open lid using Servo mototr.

On te other hand one ultrasonic sensor has been placed uder the lid and top of the bin to sense the level of th trash and blow the LED light if it is full.

So the person would know when to change or empty the dustbin.

#Result

The result we are going to recieve would be the processed data of the Arduino attached to the dustbin.
This project will also result into a better and clean environment.
This project will also lead to a better coordination in cleanliness system of small campuses.
This project will lead to a environment where distance between human and technology would be less.
